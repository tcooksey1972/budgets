  # Nested template for AWS Budgets and SNS Topic creation.
Description: AWS Budget and SNS Topic Creation


# Notes:
# Step 1: Set Up AWS Budgets
# - Budget Creation: This template creates a monthly cost budget of $1,000.
# - Notifications: Configures budget notifications at 60%, 80%, 90%, and 100% thresholds sent to an SNS topic.
# - Customization: Modify the CostFilters section to tailor the budget for specific AWS services if needed.
#
# Step 2: Set Up SNS Topic
# - SNS Topic Creation: Creates an SNS topic named "BudgetAlerts".
# - Email Subscription (optional): Add an email subscription to receive alerts directly. This step must be completed manually in the AWS console as email subscriptions require confirmation.
